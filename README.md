Project 1 is a website based around myself and my resume. It is a website showcasing myself and what I have done job wise and project wise.

Project 2 is a website that is a prototype of a homegoods-like store i created. There are plenty of great colors and alot of product cards showcasing rugs, lamps etc.

Project 3 is a website jam packed with information about raising new borns and toddlers. Few pictures here and there of cute babies and also on my foods page there are pictures at the bottom of very popular food right now in 2022.
